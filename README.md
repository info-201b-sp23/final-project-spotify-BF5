# Introduction

Spotify has a massive catalog of music with every genre imaginable and a massive amount of users. Underground and famous artists alike have their music on the platform. But what songs are being listened to the most? Why are they the most popular? Is it more than the artist being a celebrity? Our analysis of this dataset can answer the technical questions of why a song is popular. Not every song a celebrity produces is on the top of the billboards. Even underground artists have a chance of receiving popularity with a hit track. We can draw connections between the popularity of a song and the various components in a song. The dataset we will be using has several columns of data containing the tempo, time signature, mode, etc. Danceability and genre are also included in this. Understanding why certain songs are more popular could lead to the promotion of lesser known songs which fit the criteria of being a popular song. Or to show users songs that do not fit the criteria if they want to listen to a greater variety of music. Music is a heavily subjective topic, not everyone has the same music taste. By analyzing the data, we can find similarities in the most popular songs.

We will be finding:

-   What genre tends to be the most popular among popular songs?

-   What technical aspects are similar between popular songs?

-   Does danceability lend a hand in making a song popular?

-   As well as other interesting findings in our data.
